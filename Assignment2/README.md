## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
This assignment took me a total of 8 hours and 20 minutes over about 2 weeks.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am most satisfied with the functionality of my program. The program works very well, and all of the functionality that I needed works.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am probably least satisfied with the kivy side, as the left hand side bar of my app takes up half the screen and I would have prefered to have it be smaller.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The things that worked well in my developement process were mainly the structure of how I had to set out my program. Once I was able to have all the classes
and their respective functions in place it made it a lot easier to work.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
The initial stage of my process, the building of the classes, could be improved next time as originally I had no idea how to go about it.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
The resources I used were the lecture notes and examples, as well as examples from other pracs and some help from online.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge that I faced was the creating of the classes, I originally had no idea how to go about this and I overcome it by seeking help from Trevor.
